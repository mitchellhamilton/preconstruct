# Configuration

Preconstruct accepts configuration at three different configuration points; projects, packages and entrypoints. These configuration points can be represented by one package.json or by 20 package.jsons, it depends on the requirements of a specific project. For example, in a single package repo with one entrypoint, it would be represented by a single package.json.
