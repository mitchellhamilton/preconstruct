# Entrypoints

Entrypoints are the lowest level configuration point and describe a set of bundles for a particular entrypoint.

## `source`

`string`

`source` specifies the source file to use for a given entrypoint. It's resolved relative to the package.json where it's specified.

### Default

> Note: this is the default value, if it's what you want, you don't need to specify it.

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "source": "src/index"
  }
}
```

### Example

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "source": "modules/index"
  }
}
```

## Build types

Build types specify what types of bundles Preconstruct should build. They are specified via the package.json fields which Node and bundlers like webpack look at to find bundles. It's important to note that **all** of the entrypoints in a package must have the same build types, this is necessary to ensure that common dependencies between entrypoints aren't duplicated.

### `main`

The `main` field specifies a CommonJS build. It is the only build type which is **required**. This bundle will work in Node and can work in bundlers like webpack but a ES Module build is recommended for bundlers like webpack.

Example:

```jsx
{
  "main": "dist/my-package.cjs.js"
}
```

### `module`

The `module` field specifies an ES Module build. This bundle is what bundlers like webpack will use.

Example:

```jsx
{
  "module": "dist/my-package.esm.js"
}
```

### `umd:main`

The `umd:main` field specifies a UMD build. This bundle can be used directly in a browser with a `<script>` tag.

Example:

```jsx
{
  "umd:main": "dist/my-package.umd.min.js"
}
```

<!-- TODO: maybe talk about browser builds, not 100% sure though. -->
