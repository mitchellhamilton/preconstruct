# Configuration

Preconstruct accepts configuration at three different configuration points; projects, packages and entrypoints. These configuration points can be represented by one package.json or by 20 package.jsons, it depends on the requirements of a specific project. For example, in a single package repo with one entrypoint, it would be represented by a single package.json.

Projects map 1:1 with a version control repository. They specify global configuration that applies to all builds.

## Projects

### `packages`

`Array<string>`

`packages` is an array of globs which specify which packages should be built with preconstruct.

#### Default

> Note: this is the default value, if it's what you want, you don't need to specify it.

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "packages": ["."]
  }
}
```

#### Example

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "packages": ["packages/*"]
  }
}
```

### `globals`

`{ [packageName: string]: (umdName: string) }`

`globals` specifies the UMD names of `peerDependencies` since `peerDependencies` aren't bundled in UMD builds. You **shouldn't** specify this option manually, preconstruct will prompt you for the UMD name of a package when it's necessary.

#### Default

> Note: this is the default value, if it's what you want, you don't need to specify it.

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "globals": {}
  }
}
```

#### Example

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "globals": {
      "react": "React",
      "react-dom": "ReactDOM"
    }
  }
}
```

## Packages

Packages map 1:1 with npm packages. Along with specifying the `entrypoints` option described below, packages are also responsible for specifying dependencies which is necessary for bundling UMD bundles and ensuring that packages will have all of their required dependencies when installed through npm.

### `entrypoints`

`Array<string>`

`entrypoints` is an array of globs which specify the entrypoints which consumers of your package should be able to import.

#### Default

> Note: this is the default value, if it's what you want, you don't need to specify it.

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "entrypoints": ["."]
  }
}
```

#### Example

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "entrypoints": [".", "other-entrypoint"]
  }
}
```

## Entrypoints

Entrypoints are the lowest level configuration point and describe a set of bundles for a particular entrypoint. They are configured by the `package.json` in the folder of the entrypoint. We also have a guide on [adding a second entrypoint](/guides/adding-a-second-entrypoint)

### `source`

`string`

`source` specifies the source file to use for a given entrypoint. It's resolved relative to the package.json where it's specified.

#### Default

> Note: this is the default value, if it's what you want, you don't need to specify it.

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "source": "src/index"
  }
}
```

#### Example

```json
{
  "preconstruct": {
    "source": "modules/index"
  }
}
```

### Build types

Build types specify what types of bundles Preconstruct should build. They are specified via the package.json fields which Node and bundlers like webpack look at to find bundles. It's important to note that **all** of the entrypoints in a package must have the same build types, this is necessary to ensure that common dependencies between entrypoints aren't duplicated.

#### `main`

The `main` field specifies a CommonJS build. It is the only build type which is **required**. This bundle will work in Node and can work in bundlers like webpack but a ES Module build is recommended for bundlers like webpack.

Example:

```jsx
{
  "main": "dist/my-package.cjs.js"
}
```

#### `module`

The `module` field specifies an ES Module build. This bundle is what bundlers like webpack will use.

Example:

```jsx
{
  "module": "dist/my-package.esm.js"
}
```

#### `umd:main`

The `umd:main` field specifies a UMD build. This bundle can be used directly in a browser with a `<script>` tag.

Example:

```jsx
{
  "umd:main": "dist/my-package.umd.min.js"
}
```
