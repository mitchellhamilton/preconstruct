# Exporting Multiple Entrypoints

> **Note:** this tutorial builds upon [the Getting Started tutorial](/tutorials) so if you haven't gone through it, you should do that first.

We're going to create another package from `a-random-number` called `a-random-number-with-create` and add another entrypoint called `create` so that people can import `a-random-number-with-create/create` to create their own random numbers and still import `a-random-number-with-create` to get a random number.

The first thing we're going to do is create our entrypoint directory.

```bash
mkdir create
```

Then we can set what the entrypoints for our package should be.

```json
"preconstruct": {
  "entrypoints": [
    ".",
    "create"
  ]
}
```

  What does <code>"."</code> mean here?
</summary>

`"."` is referring to the current directory so in this context it means that the current directory should be an entrypoint. So consumers should be able to import `a-random-number` (`"."`) and `a-random-number/create` (`"create"`)

</details>

If we run `yarn preconstruct fix` now, it'll ask us a question and fix any problems with our project.

```bash
🎁 ? a-random-number-with-create A package.json file does not exist for this entrypoint, would you like to create one automatically? Yes
🎁 error a-random-number-with-create/create no source file was provided, please create a file at src/index or specify a custom source file with the preconstruct source option
```

Now preconstruct is complaining that there isn't a source file so we need to create one. We're going to create one at `src/create.js`

```jsx
export let createRandom = () => Math.random();
```

We're also going to change `src/index.js` to use our new `createRandom` function

```jsx
import { createRandom } from "./create";

export let random = createRandom();
```

Since the source file for our `create` entrypoint isn't at the default of `src/index.js` relative to the entrypoint, we need to use the `source` option in the `package.json` in the `create` directory.

```json
{
  "main": "dist/a-random-number-with-create.cjs.js",
  "module": "dist/a-random-number-with-create.esm.js",
  "preconstruct": {
    "source": "../src/random"
  }
}
```

Now if we run `yarn preconstruct build`, everything will work and after publishing the package, people can import `a-random-number-with-create/create`.
