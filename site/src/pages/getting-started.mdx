# Getting Started

> **Note:** If you're new to building packages, you should go through [Preconstruct's tutorials](/tutorials)

Preconstruct is a build tool that aims to simplify a lot of the complexity in building packages.

Assuming you've already got a package and your source file is at `src/index.js`(or `src/index.ts` if you're using TypeScript) or you have a multi-package repo with Yarn Workspaces that has packages with source files, you can install Preconstruct and run `preconstruct init` to setup Preconstruct.

```bash
yarn add --dev preconstruct
yarn preconstruct init
```

Preconstruct will ask some questions about your project and then update your package.json.

You'll now be able to build your project.

```bash
yarn preconstruct build
```
