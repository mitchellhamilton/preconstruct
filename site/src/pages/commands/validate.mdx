# `validate`

```bash
preconstruct validate
```

`preconstruct validate` checks that the project, packages and entrypoints are all valid.

> Note: A build can still fail even if validate doesn't fail because there are some checks which can only happen during a build

<!-- Thing that should be thought about: should validate do a build but not write to disk? -->
