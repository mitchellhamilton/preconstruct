# `watch`

```bash
preconstruct watch
```

`preconstruct watch` is similar to `preconstruct build` except instead of doing a single build, it starts a watcher and rebuilds the project whenever there are changes.

`preconstruct watch` is only intended to be used as a last resort when `preconstruct dev` cannot be used. If you have a use case that `preconstruct watch` solves but `preconstruct dev` does not, please open an issue.
